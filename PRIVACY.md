**Last Updated:** January 2025

## Overview

Quran Memorizer ("the App") is developed by Donald Cjapi. This privacy policy explains how the App handles your information.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect any personal data on our servers.**

The App operates primarily on your device and does not:
- Collect personal information on external servers
- Track your location
- Access your contacts
- Send data to third-party analytics services

## Sign in with Apple (Optional)

If you choose to sign in with Apple:
- Your Apple ID is used solely to identify your account for iCloud sync
- We receive only the user identifier Apple provides (and optionally your name/email if you choose to share them)
- This information is not shared with any third parties
- You can sign out or delete your account at any time

## iCloud Sync (Optional)

When signed in with Apple, the App uses your private iCloud storage to sync:
- **Memorization Progress:** Your surah and ayah memorization status
- **App Preferences:** Selected reciter preferences

This data is:
- Stored in your personal iCloud account (Apple's private CloudKit database)
- Encrypted and accessible only to you
- Not accessible to us or any third party
- Automatically deleted when you delete your account in the app

## Data Stored on Your Device

The App stores the following data locally:

- **Memorization Progress:** Your surah and ayah memorization status
- **App Preferences:** Theme settings, selected reciter, playback preferences
- **Downloaded Audio:** Quran recitations you choose to download for offline use

Local data remains on your device even if you sign out of iCloud.

## Third-Party Services

The App uses the following third-party services:

**Apple iCloud (CloudKit)**
- Purpose: Optional sync of memorization progress across your devices
